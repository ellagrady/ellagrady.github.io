                            <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
                            <p>
                            I grew up moving around a lot, spending part of my childhood in Europe, but have spent most of my life in New England.
                            Most recently, I have called Maine home, attending high school there, where I grew into my interests in political science
                            and computer science. I chose to attend Clark University, knowing my intended majors, because I valued the liberal arts 
                            education, making the choice to prioritize an education that would make me a well-rounded individual and give me an 
                            interdisciplinary approach. During my time at Clark, I took advantage of the study abroad program, spending a year studying
                            in Scotland, at the University of Stirling, taking classes in both my majors, and exploring other interests and travelling whenever I could.

                                    <p>
                                    I have been taking Computer Science classes since my sophomore year of high school, and started my major my first 
                                    semester at Clark. I followed the path, taking the required Intro to CS (in Python), Data Structures (in Java), Algorithms, 
                                    Analysis of Programming Languages, Automata Theory, and Computer Organization & Machine Languages. When it came time to 
                                    choose my electives, I took Computer Security & Networks, Managing Information, NoSQL Databases & Data Warehousing, and Operating Systems.
                                    I completed two internships, the first at L.L. Bean as a Customer Satisfaction Process and Technology Intern, and the second as 
                                    a Data Technology Intern at Global Atlantic Financial Group, and my work from which qualified as my Computer Science capstone graduation requirement.

                                    <p> 
                                    I have been interested in learning about politics as long as I can remember, asking my parents about elections and the political
                                    discussions they were having from a young age. Through government and history classes throughout school, this interest was solidified. 
                                    I began my PoliSci studies at Clark from day 1, focusing on the American Politics and Public Policy track. I took classes such as Intro 
                                    to American Government, the American Presidency, Policy Analysis, and US National Security. I took an American History class, covering 
                                    1787-1890 while studying in Scotland, seeing US history from an outside perspective. Clark is great for Political Science as well for requiring
                                    courses outside the track, so I also took classes in international relations and comparitive politics, including Intro to Comparative Politics, 
                                    International Organizations, Russian Politics, and Nations & Nationalism, as well as more general classes like Economics, Roots of Political Thought, 
                                    and Research Methods. I completed my American Politics Capstone in the course the Politics of Food and Drink, researching the racial inequalities of 
                                    food insecurity in the United States. Additionally, I am currently completing a directed study of independent research on the impacts of AI on US
                                    national security strategies.

                                    Clark requires all students complete 9 additional requirements for the Program of Liberal Studies. These include courses focused on diversity, 
                                    formal analysis, global, scientific, values, and cultural perspectives, among others. In my completion of these I took many interesting classes I benefited from and enjoyed, 
                                    including Jazz Biographies, – the history of many famous jazz musicians – Modernism and Modernity, – and English course focused on the Modernist authors – and Spanish.

                            <h2>Why I Do What I Do</h2>
                            <p>
                            The first comment I often get after being asked what I am studying is 
                            "huh, computer science and political science are completely unrelated."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            While at first glance, computer science and political science seem to 
                            share no similarities, at a closer look, like many things, connections 
                            can be drawn. I am interested in cybersecurity topics of data privacy, 
                            cyber law, and cyber warfare. In political science, I am interested in 
                            voter rights, government procedures, and legal justice. As our world 
                            becomes increasingly more online, those issues of cybersecurity become 
                            more prevalent in our politics and will begin to affect the rights of individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Throughout my courses so far, I have been able to combine my interests 
                            in my research and projects, analyzing political data through programs 
                            I designed, and discussing the impact of the cyber laws we have so far, 
                            and how they need to be adapted as technology advances. My research has
                            involved analyzing the data privacy regulations of various international 
                            organizations, as well as the impacts AI has had and will continue to have 
                            on US national security concerns and international, global relations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I am a quick learner, with a strong self-motivation and level-headed 
                            management of my work when under pressure or in stressful situations. 
                            I excel in my ability to work independently, and with limited direction, 
                            but also enjoy and thrive working in a team environment. I have strong 
                            communication skills with both coworkers and customers, skills I have 
                            developed and strengthened in my time in customer service.
                            </p>
                            

                            <h2>A Few More Words About Myself</h2>
                            <p>
                            Most recently this year I have taken on a leadership position as Vice President
                            of Clark Competitive Computing Club (C4). This club is one of the tech focused 
                            clubs on campus. Our goal is to create a community amongst computer science students
                            at Clark, supporting students throughout the program and through their career searches. 
                            We hold many different events, from panels, to workshops, to student get-togethers. 
                            We are also very passionate about making computer science more diverse and accessible 
                            for different groups, to this end we regularly hold outreach events to teach coding to 
                            young students in the Worcester community, partnering with other Clark clubs, and other 
                            events (our "Code@Clark" series) to help members of the Clark community become more comfortable
                            with tech skills. One of our major events we hold every semester is our 48-hour hackathons.
                            The hackathons we have hosted whilst I've been Vice President have been major successes, garnering
                            projects that have been promoted around campus as actionable solutions, and gaining much more
                            attention and praise for our small, but mighty, computer science department.

                    <p align="justify">
                        I am a student at Clark University, graduating in May 2024 with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and Political Science. 
                        I am passionate about making STEM more accessible and diverse, encouraging underreprsented minorities to pursue computer science 
                        is something I champion, especially in my role as Vice President of Clark Competitive Computing Club. I also love to look for ways 
                        to combine my two interests, such as research on the national security implications of AI, or digital applications for designing a 
                        visualization and calculations of political data.
