                            In May 2024, I graduated from Clark University, with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and Political Science, with 
                            Latin Honors, summa cum laude. I am passionate about making STEM more accessible and diverse, encouraging underrepresented 
                            minorities to pursue computer science is something I champion, and was a particular focus in my role as Vice President of Clark Competitive 
                            Computing Club. I also love to look for ways to combine my two interests, such as research on the national security implications 
                            of AI, or digital applications for designing visualizations and calculations of political data, most recently following these 
                            passions into civic tech. 
                            <br><br>
                            I am passionate about tech policy and responsible technology. I think it's crucial that our technology be shaped so it is human-centric, with
                            ethical guidelines, - around fairness, bias mitigation, privacy protections, and accountability - transparent, sustainable, and accountable. 
                            We can see over the past couple of years how responsible technology has emerged from its position as a niche topic to a mainstream focus in policy, 
                            corporate strategy, and the media - particularly with the growth of AI. With an interdisciplinary academic background in computer science and political
                            science, and work experience in government tech, I have seen firsthand the rise in importance of tech policy, and look for ways to apply my background
                            and experience to this space. What's so desperately need in tech policy is people to bridge that gap - someone who understands the technical jargon, who 
                            can translate that into key issues, recommendations, and actionable policies, expertise I feel I can contribute.

                                        Following my graduation from Clark, I took a position as a Software Engineering Fellow
                                        with the <a href="https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/">United States Digital Corps</a>. USDC is 
                                        a full-time 2 year early-career technologist opportunity to create a government that better serves
                                        the American public. The intent of the program is to place each fellow at an agency working
                                        on high-impact projects to improve the digital maturity of government services. At the time 
                                        I begun, I was very excited to be joining a supportive community that was focused on and aligned 
                                        with my values of more accessibility and diversity in the tech field. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I was placed on a team 
                                        at the United States Geological Survey, within their Water Mission Area. In my time there, 
                                        I have worked on internet water data portals, including the <a href="https://waterqualitydata.us/">
                                        Water Quality Portal</a> and the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/apps/ngwmn/">National Groundwater 
                                        Monitoring Network</a> to serve data about our nation's water resources, products
                                        that are often used by researchers, scientists, environmentalists, as well as politicians to shape 
                                        our nation's regulations and policies. My work as a full-stack engineer, on a small team with two
                                        other developers, has helped me learn a lot, and develop as a technologist in my first post-grad role. My
                                        tasks range from frontend UI updates, to website architecture and design modernization efforts, to 
                                        research on technology options, and leading and designing a cloud deployment processes with AWS CDK. 
                                        Working in civic tech often means 
                                        navigating legacy tech stacks, and years of code being built upon outdated code and system styles, 
                                        and I quickly became adept at navigating and leading development on the various projects, their stacks, and the quirks that
                                        came with their system design.

                                        <br>
                                        In addition to my work at USGS, the fellowship has a huge focus on prioritizing our individual growth, 
                                        both professionally and personally, something I can attest to from my time. With regular learning and 
                                        development sessions, supporting individual learning, and opportunities to explore other interests, I have found
                                        myself constantly learning and working with my peers on different issues. This included working groups I joined, 
                                        and time spent researching and presenting on topics like the history of healthcare policy in the US from the 
                                        colonial era to today, to cross-track (between engineers, product managers, cybersecurity analysts, and designers) 
                                        collaboration to explore solutions to improve communications between the government and the public. My time in this 
                                        role has been invaluable for my development professionally and personally. Working for the American public in this 
                                        way has been an honor and something I have loved to do.

                                    The first time I ever wrote code was learning to build a website on Tumblr's code platform in middle school - I thought it would
                                    be a cool skill, but it still didn't hook me. It wasn't unitl I took a Computer Science class in my sophomore year of high school 
                                    and saw just how interesting this field could be, that I set my sights on Computer Science. I started my major my first 
                                    semester at Clark, and followed the path, taking the required Intro to CS (in Python), Data Structures (in Java), Algorithms, 
                                    Analysis of Programming Languages, Automata Theory, and Computer Organization & Machine Languages. When it came time to 
                                    choose my electives, I took Computer Security & Networks, Managing Information, NoSQL Databases & Data Warehousing, and Operating Systems.
                                    I completed two internships, the first at L.L. Bean as a Customer Satisfaction Process and Technology Intern, and the second as 
                                    a Data Technology Intern at Global Atlantic Financial Group, my work from which qualified as my Computer Science capstone graduation requirement.

                                    I have been interested in learning about politics as long as I can remember, asking my parents about elections and the political
                                    discussions they were having from a young age. Through government and history classes throughout school, this interest was solidified. 
                                    I began my Political Sceince studies at Clark from Day 1, focusing on the American Politics and Public Policy track. I took classes such as Intro 
                                    to American Government, the American Presidency, Policy Analysis, and US National Security. I took an American History class, covering 
                                    1787-1890 while studying in Scotland, wanting to see US history from an outside perspective. To fulfill the requirement of courses
                                    outside your chosen track, I also took classes in international relations and comparative politics, including Intro to Comparative Politics, 
                                    International Organizations, Russian Politics, and Nations & Nationalism, as well as more general classes like Economics, Roots of Political Thought, 
                                    and Research Methods. I completed my American Politics Capstone in the course the Politics of Food and Drink, researching the racial inequalities of 
                                    food insecurity in the United States. Additionally, in true Clark fashion, I was supported by my professors to pusure the things that interest me 
                                    beyond the offered classes, and worked with one of my professors to complete a directed study of independent research on the impacts of AI on US
                                    national security strategies.

                                    Clark requires all students complete 9 additional requirements for the Program of Liberal Studies. These include courses focused on diversity, 
                                    formal analysis, global, scientific, values, and cultural perspectives, among others. In my completion of these I took many interesting classes I benefited from and enjoyed, 
                                    including Jazz Biographies, – the history of many famous jazz musicians – Modernism and Modernity, – an English course focused on Modernist authors – and Spanish.

                            <h2>Why I Do What I Do</h2>
                            <p>
                            The first comment I often get after being asked where my interests lie is 
                            "huh, computer science and political science are completely unrelated."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            While at first glance, computer science and political science seem to 
                            share no similarities, at a closer look, like many things, connections 
                            can be drawn. I am interested in cybersecurity topics of data privacy, 
                            cyber law, and cyber warfare. In political science, I am interested in 
                            voter rights, government procedures, and legal justice. As our world 
                            becomes increasingly more online, those issues of cybersecurity become 
                            more prevalent in our politics and will begin to affect the rights of individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Throughout my time in university, I was able to combine my interests 
                            in my research and projects, analyzing political data through programs 
                            I designed, and discussing the impact of the cyber laws we have so far, 
                            and how they need to be adapted as technology advances. My research 
                            involved analyzing the data privacy regulations of various international 
                            organizations, as well as the impacts AI has had and will continue to have 
                            on US national security concerns and international, global relations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Though my work experience since graduating has been much more technical 
                            focused, as a Software Engineer, I still find myself getting to apply
                            my political science knowledge and interests more than people likely expect.
                            Whether it be the implications for the products I work on being funded or mandated
                            by Congress, the limitations of the federal budget, or regulations I have to follow
                            as a government employee, I typically am affected and thinking of policies every day.
                            Beyond that, as part of the educational nature of the fellowship program, I am able 
                            to pursue topics outside of my specific role, often getting to put my political science
                            expertise to use, for instance researching and presenting on the history of healthcare policy
                            in the US to a group of my fellow Fellows in a working group, putting my research and 
                            policy analysis skills into practice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I am a quick learner, with a strong self-motivation and level-headed 
                            management of my work when under pressure or in stressful situations. 
                            I excel in my ability to work independently, and with limited direction, 
                            but also enjoy and thrive working in a team environment. I have strong 
                            communication skills with both coworkers and customers, skills I have 
                            developed and strengthened in my time in customer service and collaboration
                            with my team.
                            </p>
                            

                            <h2>A Few More Words About My Experience</h2>
                            <p>
                            In my final year at Clark I took on a leadership position as Vice President
                            of Clark Competitive Computing Club (C4). This club is one of the tech focused 
                            clubs on campus. Our goal was to create a community amongst computer science students
                            at Clark, supporting students throughout the program and through their career searches. 
                            We held many different events, from panels, to workshops, to student get-togethers. 
                            We were also very passionate about making computer science more diverse and accessible 
                            for different groups, to this end we regularly held outreach events to teach coding to 
                            young students in the Worcester community, partnering with other Clark clubs, and other 
                            events (our "Code@Clark" series) to help members of the Clark community become more comfortable
                            with tech skills. When I stepped into the role, I knew one of the areas I wanted to work on was 
                            community outreach. My interest started in CS because of a required coding class in high school and 
                            a field trip to IBM to see their programs focusing on women in tech. From that moment, everything 
                            clicked and I knew what I wanted. All it takes is one moment to introduce the right kid to the right field, 
                            and my hope was that by exposing kids in Worcester to tech, through our outreach events, teaching coding 
                            through Lego Education Robot kits, that at least person would find something they really loved. The hope 
                            also was that with our E-Board of mostly women, and people of color, that these kids could see themselves 
                            in this field and see a future doing this. This is an idea I also tried to carry into the rest of our club 
                            events on campus, hoping to bring more women and people of color into the major, and show them that if I can 
                            do it, succeed, and hold leadership, that they could too. One of our major events we held every semester is 
                            our 48-hour hackathons. The hackathons we hosted while I was Vice President were major 
                            successes, garnering projects that have been promoted around campus as actionable solutions, and gaining much more
                            attention and praise from across campus for our small, but mighty, computer science department.

                    <p align="justify">
                        I am a software engineer in civic tech and a graduate of Clark University, Class of 2024, with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and Political Science. 
                        I am passionate about digital policy and responsible tech, finding ways to regulate and guide responsible development in a world of innovation. 
                        I  love to look for ways 
                        to combine my two interests, such as research on the national security implications of AI, or digital applications for designing a 
                        visualization and calculations of political data, most recently following those passions into civic tech. Making STEM more accessible and diverse, encouraging underrepresented minorities to pursue computer science 
                        is another thing I attempt to champion in my work.
