We prefer the footer credit that comes with the template but you are still free to move it 
somewhere else.



If you have any questions about the License, feel free to contact us.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


REMOVING THE ATTRIBUTION LINK:

We understand that there are situations where you want to use our templates without 
the crediting obligation. If that's your case, you can always send us a 
credit removal fee of 10 USD through Paypal. This will allow you to use a single 
template attribution/credit link free on ONE DOMAIN name.

You can send your payments through Paypal to this address: ealigam@gmail.com or
visit our attribution removal page: https://www.styleshout.com/attribution-free/ 
and click the pay button on the page.

SUPPORT:
    
Since MONICA is distributed for free, support is not offered. MONICA is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - https://marksheet.io/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
javascript in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials: 

 - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
 - https://javascript.info/



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 


USING THE MAILCHIMP FORM:

To use the mailchimp form you need a mailchimp url. To get the mailchimp url, login to 
your mailchimp account, click the Audience menu and select signup forms. Then choose 
embedded forms and select unstyled form. In the generated form code get the value of 
the form ACTION attribute and use it as your mailchimp url. Open the main.js file located
in the template's "js" folder and look for this line of code: 

const cfg = {

    // MailChimp URL
    mailChimpURL : 'https://facebook.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=1abf75f6981256963a47d197a&amp;id=37c6d8f4d6' 

};


Replace the value of mailChimpURL with your mailchimp url.
